## Quick Start
1. Sign Up for an account by typing in your username and password
2. Login
3. Make Request or browse through existing requests and choose someone to lend your items to

## Inspiration
There were times when we came all the way to hall only to realise something was left back at home. 
Chances are, someone else in hall has it too and would be happy to lend you that item, but it is tedious to ask around in various chats to check who has it. Why not have a centralised platform to accomplish this task? 
## What it does
GetThatBread is a website that allows users to view or post item borrow requests. 
Users will be able to see who requested what item, and also the duration the item is being requested for. 
## How we built it
Using a React app.
## Challenges we ran into
* Deciding the process of making a borrow request (which details are needed, actions that can be taken etc)
* Authentication 
## What's next for GetThatBread
* Improvements to user experience 
* Expansion to loan management system for CCA equipments
